# yeeoldterminal
I made a REALLY really bad terminal thing, and I thought that people will either laugh or be semi-interested in it.
Or not, I'm just posting some old projects.

PS. This code was kinda using an online IDEs enviromental variables and I dont care enough to figure those out so some stuff might be broken
Why am I making a Github repo for 1 file?
